        <h1>About Sasha</h1>
        <p>Sasha Horokh, the president of Ukraine@MIT has gone back to Ukraine to volunteer related to the ongoing war.</p>
        <p>Sasha’s biggest focus right now is to raise money that can be used for humanitarian aid. Most of the requests are urgent, 
            so they have to manage ordering different packages from different countries on a daily basis. The biggest proportion of 
            the aid is medical, but they also buy some specific things for specific problems like water disinfection pills, as in 
            some places there is no drinking water available, or glasses for service dogs looking for landmines to protect their 
            eyes from potential bomb wreckage. Food is also delivered frequently along with energy drinks since sometimes people 
            do not have enough time to sleep but need to focus.</p>
        <p>Sasha’s normal day consists of organizing all these things, meanwhile there is a constant air raid going on. The shop’s 
            glass doors are covered with tape, so in case of bombing the fragments won’t injure anyone around, but they continue to 
            operate, and most of the necessities can be purchased in the city. Currently a salt shortage is going on, the biggest 
            salt production place in Ukraine is in the war zone right now. There are a lot of kids around, and kindergartens work, 
            but with their windows covered in cardboards.</p>
        <p>Sasha will continue to work on different projects through the summer, I will try to post more frequently about it. If 
            you want to support Sasha, you can send money to their PayPal directly to @shorokhForUA or card 4149439318303496 (one 
            can use Wise, for instance, for international transfers). They are coming from a low income family, and because of the 
            big number of the requests, they are already using their small amount of savings to purchase some of the items.</p>
        <p>Thank you everyone for reading this article, and special thank you to anyone who can contribute, even with a small amount!</p>
